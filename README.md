Welcome to ScrapBook Online!!!

This is an easy-to-use online platform for users to share their experiences and interact with others using pictures.
Users, who will be called ScrapBookers, will be able to create an account and upload pictures on 
their ScrapBook. ScrapBookers will have the option to leave comments on others ScrapBookers pictures in order to 
create a welcoming community. ScrapBookers will have the chance to follow their favorite ScrapBookers and friends so that 
they get notified when the followee uploads a picture to their ScrapBook.

Here are some rules to follow in order to make the code look good and easily maintainable.
1. Use Camel Casing.
2. Give appropriate descriptive name to variable. (e.g. NOT 'num1')
3. Comment every function with pertinent description of what it does and the intent.
4. Have adequate spacing. 
5. Lines in editor should not exceed the width of the page (i.e. Not horizontal scrolling)
6. Do not write deadcode; Every function written must be used and every condition must be 
	possible to execute.
